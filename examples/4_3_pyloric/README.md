# Installation Instructions

To run this example, you need to install the  [pyloric](https://github.com/mackelab/pyloric/tree/main) package.
Make sure to clone the pyloric repository **outside** of the folder structure for the 
tutorial paper, and to run `pip install .` while using the environment created for this
project.

The generated simulations and saved diagnostic results used in the notebook
